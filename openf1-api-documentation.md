Title: Introduction â€“ OpenF1 API | Real-time and historical Formula 1 data

URL Source: https://openf1.org/

OpenF1 is a free and open-source API that provides real-time and historical Formula 1 data.

The API offers a wealth of information, including lap timings, car telemetry, radio communications, and more. Whether you're looking to create interactive dashboards, dive deep into race analysis, or even develop connected objects that light up every time your favorite driver takes the lead, OpenF1 makes it all possible.

Data can be accessed in either JSON or CSV formats, making it user-friendly for both developers and non-developers alike. For a quick start, you can access the API through your web browser. A sample URL is provided for each method for easy reference.

There are 13 API methods, they are: Car data , Drivers, Intervals, Laps, Location, Meetings, Pit, Position, Race control, Sessions, Stints, Team radio, Weather

Here are some details and code examples for each of those 13 methods.


Car data
--------

Some data about each car, at a sample rate of about 3.7 Hz.

```
from urllib.request import urlopen
import json

response = urlopen('https://api.openf1.org/v1/car_data?driver_number=55&session_key=9159&speed>=315')
data = json.loads(response.read().decode('utf-8'))
print(data)

# If you want, you can import the results in a DataFrame (you need to install the `pandas` package first)
# import pandas as pd
# df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

> Output:

```

print(data)

# If you want, you can import the results in a DataFrame (you need to install the `pandas` package first)
# import pandas as pd
# df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

Data filtering
--------------

Refine your query by including parameters directly in the URL.  
Results can be filtered by any attribute, except arrays.

**Example**  
To fetch pit-out laps for driver number 55 (Carlos Sainz) that last at least 2 minutes, use: [https://api.openf1.org/v1/laps?session\_key=9222&driver\_number=55&is\_pit\_out\_lap=true&lap\_duration\>\=120](https://api.openf1.org/v1/laps?session_key=9222&driver_number=55&is_pit_out_lap=true&lap_duration%3E%3D120)

Time-Based Filtering
--------------------

You can narrow down your results using time ranges.

**Example**  
To get all sessions in September 2023, use: [https://api.openf1.org/v1/sessions?date\_start\>\=2023-09-01&date\_end<\=2023-09-30](https://api.openf1.org/v1/sessions?date_start%3E%3D2023-09-01&date_end%3C%3D2023-09-30)

The API supports a wide range of date formats (those compatible with Python's `dateutil.parser.parse` method). Examples include:

*   "2021-09-10"
*   "2021-09-10T14:30:20"
*   "2021-09-10T14:30:20+00:00"
*   "09/10/2021"
*   "09-10-2021"
*   "Fri Sep 10 14:30:20 2021"
*   "10 September 2021"
*   "Sep 10, 2021"
*   "2021-09-10 14:30:20 UTC"
*   "2021-09-10 14:30:20+00:00"
*   "2021-09-10 14:30:20 EST"
*   ...and many more.

CSV Format
----------

To receive your query results in CSV format instead of the default JSON, simply append the query parameter `csv=true` to your URL. This feature is particularly handy to import the data into spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel.

**Example**  
To get all sessions for the year 2023 in CSV format, use the following URL: [https://api.openf1.org/v1/sessions?year=2023&csv=true](https://api.openf1.org/v1/sessions?year=2023&csv=true)

FAQ
---

### Can I access past data during an ongoing session?

Yes, real-time storage allows for instant access to past and current session data.

### What's the delay between live events and API updates?

The API typically updates about 3 seconds after a live event. However, this time could be extended due to factors like serverless cold starts, which occur when the service is scaling up.  
As a point of reference, F1 TV typically has a 6-second delay.

### Is there a query timeout?

Queries are limited to a 1-minute timeout. If your request takes too long, consider breaking it down into smaller queries and then combining the results.
